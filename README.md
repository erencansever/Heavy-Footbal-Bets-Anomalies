# Heavy-Bet Anomaly Study — Football Odds vs Results  
**Six Major Leagues · Three Seasons · Calibration/Anomaly Analysis**

## Project Overview
Nowadays, we hear many speculations about referees and major football teams across leagues worldwide. Some say referees manipulate matches in their favor, while others claim that teams lose intentionally in collaboration with betting companies. To gain insight into these public debates, I decided to base my project on this topic.

**Aim of the project:** I will collect match result data from the six major leagues over three seasons and pair it with information about the most frequently placed bets. Because there is no direct public data on betting volumes, I will estimate “heavily backed” sides using related datasets—specifically, pre-match odds and their movement—so that I can test whether market expectations align with actual outcomes.
