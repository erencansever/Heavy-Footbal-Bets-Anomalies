# Heavy-Bet Anomaly Study — Football Odds vs Results  
**Six Major Leagues · Three Seasons · Calibration/Anomaly Analysis**

## Project Overview
Nowadays, we hear many speculations about referees and major football teams across leagues worldwide. Some argue that referees influence matches in their favor; others claim that certain teams may underperform intentionally in coordination with betting companies. These claims are often amplified by high-profile incidents and social media discussions, but they rarely come with systematic evidence. To bring a more objective perspective to this debate, I decided to examine the relationship between market expectations before kick-off and what actually happens on the pitch.

**Aim of the project:** I will collect match result data from the six major leagues over three consecutive seasons and pair it with information that approximates the “most frequently placed bets.” Because direct betting volume data is not publicly available, I will estimate heavily backed sides using related datasets—specifically, pre-match odds and their movement from opening to closing lines, converted to vig-free implied probabilities. This approach will allow me to test whether teams that the market appears to back strongly tend to underperform relative to their final implied probabilities. The goal is not to prove intent or wrongdoing, but to produce a transparent, reproducible calibration/anomaly analysis with clear limitations and uncertainty reporting, helping to inform the broader discussion with data rather than anecdotes.
