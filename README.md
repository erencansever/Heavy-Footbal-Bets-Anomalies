# News and S&P 500: Exploring the correlations Between Headlines and Market Moves

This project analyzes whether daily news headlines (Kaggle **Daily News for Stock Market Prediction**) contain signals about the **S&P 500**’s same-day or next-day movements, using **machine learning** and **visualizations**.

---

## Project Purpose

- Quantify the relationship between headline text (sentiment, topics, keywords) and **S&P 500** returns.
- Convert text to numerical features and evaluate their explanatory/predictive power for **direction** and **magnitude** of market moves.
- Present findings through clear, reproducible analyses and **visualizations** (time-series overlays, correlation heatmaps, feature importances).

---

## Why This Project?

- **Hypothesis:** News sentiment and certain themes may provide **weak yet measurable** short-term signals for the index.
- **Motivation:** Turn unstructured news into repeatable, data-driven features to examine the **news → price** link transparently.
- **Contribution:** A reproducible research pipeline that addresses the classic question: *“Do headlines move the market in the short run?”*

## Research Questions

1. Is there a significant relationship between **headline sentiment/tonality** and **daily S&P 500 returns**?
2. Do specific **topics/keyword clusters** correlate with **up/down** outcomes?
3. Can simple text features (e.g., TF-IDF, sentiment scores) with basic ML models meaningfully outperform a **naive baseline**?
4. How stable are these relationships **over time** (market regimes, news cycles)?

## Approach (Overview)

- **Data**
  - Headlines: Kaggle **Daily News for Stock Market Prediction** (date + headline).
  - Market: Daily **S&P 500** prices/returns aligned to the same calendar.
- **Preprocessing**
  - Date alignment, handling missing days, text cleaning (lowercasing, punctuation, stopwords).
- **Feature Engineering**
  - TF-IDF / bag-of-words, sentiment scores, optional topic modeling.
- **Modeling**
  - Classification of **up vs. down** (logistic regression, tree/boosting baselines).
  - Evaluation with time-aware splits: **Accuracy**, **F1**, **ROC-AUC**, vs **naive baseline**.
- **Visualization**
  - Time-series overlays, correlation heatmaps, feature importances, sentiment-return distributions.

---

## Expected Outcomes

- A concise report and plots summarizing **where** the link is strong/weak.
- Clean, step-by-step code for **reproducibility**.
- A data-driven perspective on *how much* headlines help for short-term index direction.

---

## Limitations & Notes

- Headlines are noisy and context-limited; relationships are often **weak** and **regime-dependent**.
- This is for **research/education** only — **not investment advice**.
- Performance depends heavily on the date range, label definition, and feature engineering choices.
